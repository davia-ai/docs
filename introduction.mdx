## Why Davia? &#x20;

You’re building an **AI agent**. Your logic lives in Python, using frameworks like:

* Langchain / LangGraph

* CrewAI

* Autogen

* Pydantic AI

Your agent works, but you still need to **build a frontend** to actually use it — to input data, trigger processes, and display responses.

With Davia, you can **design this frontend directly in a visual editor**, without writing a single line of frontend code.
Davia handles the hard parts: connecting to your backend, managing real-time streaming, and making sure the UI fits your agent’s needs.

## What Davia does for you

✅ No need to connect your frontend to your backend — Davia knows how to talk to your agent

✅ No need to handle streaming or incremental outputs — Davia handles it for you

✅ No need to think about frontend logic — Davia lets you design visuallyå
