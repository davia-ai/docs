## Supported Framework (for now)

🔗 Currently, Davia only supports **Langgraph**.

Before using Davia, make sure your agent follows the following requirements.

## Requirements (current version)

✅ Your agent must be a **Langgraph StateGraph**
✅ Do not compile the graph (no `graph.compile()`)
✅ The agent must be in a Python file that Davia can directly import (no dynamic tricks)
✅ Your environment must have:

```bash
pip install langgraph davia
```

### Important: Do not compile your graph

Davia expects to read the raw StateGraph directly.
This will not work:

```python
graph = graph.compile()  # ❌ Don't do this
```
