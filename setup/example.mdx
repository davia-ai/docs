title: "Example — Simple Chat Agent"
---

## Install required packages

Before creating your agent, make sure you have these installed:

```bash
pip install langgraph langchain-openai davia
```

## Folder and file structure

Organize your files like this:

```bash
my_agent.py             # Contains your agent logic
.env                     # Contains your environment variables
```

## Required environment variables

Your `.env` file must contain:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=insert-your-openai-api-key
```

Replace `your-openai-api-key` with your actual OpenAI API key.

## Example agent (`my_agent.py`)

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END, MessagesState
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
import os

# Load environment variables (including OPENAI_API_KEY)
load_dotenv()

# Fail fast if the key is missing
if not os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"):
    raise ValueError("Missing OPENAI_API_KEY in your .env file")

# 1. Define the state (stores the conversation history)
class ChatState(MessagesState):
    pass

# 2. Define the model (GPT-4o using the API key from .env)
model = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-4o")

# 3. Define the agent logic (just calls the model with messages)
def run_agent(state: ChatState):
    messages = state["messages"]
    response = model.invoke(messages)
    return {"messages": response}

# 4. Build the StateGraph
graph = StateGraph(ChatState)

graph.add_node("agent", run_agent)
graph.add_edge(START, "agent")
graph.add_edge("agent", END)
```

## Run Davia

Once your files are in place and correctly set up, run on your terminal:

```bash
davia dev my_agent:graph
```

Davia will open your project on [sandbox.davia.ai](https://sandbox.davia.ai/), and you’ll be able to design your frontend for this chat agent.

## Set the message property

Once Davia opens, you will be asked to **select where messages are stored in your agent's state**.

Select the property called **`messages`** and click **Save**.

This tells Davia where to find the conversation history to display in your frontend chat interface.

✅ That’s it — your agent is now fully connected to Davia, and **your frontend is ready to use**.
