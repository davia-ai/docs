## Install Davia

Run:

```bash
pip install davia
```

## Connect your agent

Run Daviaâ€™s dev command, pointing to your agentâ€™s backend graph or workflow:

```bash
davia dev [graph_path]
```

Where:

* `graph_path` points to your agent definition.

* This can be a **Langgraph StateGraph**, or in the future a **CrewAI Crew**, or other supported formats.

**Example :**

If your graph is defined in `my_project/graphs/my_agent.py`:

```python
# my_agent.py
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph

graph = StateGraph()
```

You run:

```
davia dev my_agent:graph
```

## Open Davia Platform

Once the command runs, Davia launches your project on:

ðŸ‘‰ [sandbox.davia.ai](https://sandbox.davia.ai)

From there, you can **design your frontend** without writing code:

* Customize how responses are displayed (streaming, final output, etc.)

* Add input fields (text, files, dropdownsâ€¦)

* Define buttons to trigger actions

* Organize everything into sections and layouts

## Test your UI

Your frontend is **live-connected** to your agent.
You can test it directly inside Davia â€” input real data, run your agent, and see how the response flows back into the UI.

Thatâ€™s it!
Youâ€™ve built a working frontend for your agent **in minutes**, without writing frontend code.
